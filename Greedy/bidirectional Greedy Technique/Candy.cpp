ðŸ“Œ Where to Use This Technique:
You can use the two-pass greedy pattern in problems such as:
| Problem Type                                    | Description                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Candy Distribution**                          | Like your example â€” ensure children with higher ratings get more candy than neighbors. |
| **Gas Station Problem**                         | Simulate trips in both directions.                                                     |
| **Mountain / Peak Problems**                    | Handle increasing/decreasing patterns like finding the longest mountain.               |
| **Stock Buy & Sell (at most two transactions)** | Forward and backward pass to track profits.                                            |
| **Histogram problems**                          | Like "Trapping Rain Water" â€” requires left max and right max.                          |
| **Scheduling / Rewards**                        | Enforce increasing constraints on both sides.                                          |
